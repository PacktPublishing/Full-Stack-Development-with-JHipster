## About the Book
JHipster is a development platform to generate, develop, and deploy Spring Boot and Angular/React applications and Spring microservices. It provides you with a variety of tools that will help you quickly build modern web applications. This book will be your guide to building full stack applications with Spring and Angular using the JHipster tool set.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All code files are placed in their respective folders.

Chapters 1, 2, 8, and 14 do not contain code files.


The code will look like the following:
```
entity Product {
     name String required
     description String
     price BigDecimal required min(0)
     size Size required
     image ImageBlob
}
enum Size {
     S, M, L, XL, XXL
}
entity ProductCategory {
     name String required
     description String
}
```
